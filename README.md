## üì¶ Project Structure

- **/web**: Contains the React web application.
- **/server**: Houses the Express backend API.

## Running locally üíª

First, clone the project and change directories:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Maymisk/Duo-Finder.git
cd Duo-Finder
```

### Running the back-end server
First, change directories and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd server
```

```bash
yarn 
```
or

```bash
npm install
```

If you wanna try out the discord OAuth2, you'll need to set the environment variables as per the [**.env.example file.**](/server/.env.example)

If you don't set them, then you'll need to disable the authentication requirements for each page. This can be done by commenting the useEffect logic inside the [**withAuthRequired file.**](./web/src/utils/withAuthRequired.tsx)

Then, to run the server,  simply run the "dev" script

```bash
yarn dev
```

or
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Running the web server

First, change directories and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd web
```

```bash
yarn 
```
or

```bash
npm install
```

Run the "dev" script and [**access the 5173 localhost port!**](http://localhost:5173)

```bash
yarn dev
```

or
```bash
npm run dev
```
